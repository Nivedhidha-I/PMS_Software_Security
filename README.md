# Developing a Password Management System: A Shift-Left Approach to Security in the Software Development Lifecycle

##Project Summary

This repository contains the prototype and detailed design documentation for a basic Password Management System (PMS), created as a Master's-level assignment. The project's core focus was a practical exercise in applying Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) principles, proving the ability to integrate security controls proactively from the requirements stage ("Shift-Left") through implementation and testing.

##GRC & Security-by-Design Focus

This section demonstrates my understanding of governance mandates and preventative controls, which are vital for a GRC role:

*Secure Development Process: Applied SSDLC concepts—including requirements engineering, security planning, and testing—to integrate security controls proactively.

*Data Protection (Confidentiality): Implemented fundamental controls for securely handling and storing sensitive user data (passwords) using industry-standard hashing techniques.

*Access Control & Authentication: Focused on implementing secure and robust mechanisms for user registration and system access, which are critical for system governance.

*Risk Mitigation: The project documentation includes threat modeling and risk analysis based on the system's architecture to identify and mitigate design-level flaws.

##Project Scope & Technical Details

These specifications detail the technical environment and scope of the PMS prototype:

*Assignment Context: Master of Science in Software Security course.

*Language: Python (Used for all code and testing framework).

*Data Storage: Local JSON file (Note: All sensitive data was secured using proper hashing within the project scope).

*Core Functions: User registration, authentication, and secure management of credentials (CRUD operations).

##Repository Structure & Documentation 

The file structure reflects the comprehensive nature of the security assignment, including mandatory documentation components:

*Documentation Folder: Contains project abstract, security requirements, and system design documents (as per the report structure).

*Source Code Folder: Contains the fully-commented Python application files.

*Testing Folder: Includes security-focused test cases used to validate input handling and authentication flows.

##Key Professional Learnings

*Threat Modeling: Gained experience translating system architecture into potential attack vectors and designing security controls to mitigate them.

*Policy Implementation: Ensured code and documentation adhere to predefined security requirements, demonstrating an adherence to technical policy.

*Python for Security: Applied scripting knowledge to build functional security tools.
